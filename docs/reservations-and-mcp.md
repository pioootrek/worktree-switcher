# Reservations and MCP integration

Decision state: the reservation model and local MCP integration are implemented.

## Use an exclusive reservation, not a semaphore

Each project has one managed server slot, so the user-facing primitive is a
binary exclusive reservation. A counting semaphore would suggest several
simultaneous holders, which is not the intended behavior.

Three mechanisms remain separate:

1. An internal operation mutex serializes short start, stop, and switch state
   transitions.
2. A human hard lock pins the project to a worktree until explicit release.
3. An agent lease reserves the project temporarily and must be renewed.

The reservation overlays runtime state. A project may therefore be
`running + reserved`, `stopped + reserved`, or `failed + reserved`; reservation
does not falsely claim that the process is healthy.

## Reservation record

```ts
type Reservation = {
  id: string
  projectId: string
  worktreeId: string
  kind: "human-lock" | "agent-lease"
  owner: {
    kind: "human" | "agent"
    id: string
    displayName: string
  }
  reason: string
  createdAt: string
  expiresAt: string | null
  tokenHash: string | null
}
```

The service returns the raw lease token once and stores only its hash. The token
is required to renew or release an agent lease. Repeating an acquire request
with the same idempotency key returns the existing lease instead of creating a
second one.

Human locks may be indefinite. Agent leases default to 30 minutes, renew every
10 minutes while their bridge remains alive, have an 8-hour maximum lifetime,
and expire automatically if the client disappears. Agents can renew or release
only leases for which they hold the token. A human can force-release any
reservation through an explicit UI or CLI action; that action is audited and
is not exposed as a normal LLM tool.

A reservation is pinned to one worktree. Its owner may restart that worktree;
other actors cannot switch, stop, or restart the reserved project. Stopping the
server does not release the reservation. An owner that needs another worktree
uses one atomic move operation so ownership is never briefly dropped.

## Conflict behavior

Acquisition is an atomic compare-and-set operation. A conflict returns the
current owner, reason, pinned worktree, and expiry without switching anything.
The existing holder is never silently displaced.

The controller implements acquisition as one SQLite write transaction that
expires stale leases, checks the current claim, records the new claim, and
appends its audit event. UI, CLI, and MCP never open the database directly.

The preferred agent operation atomically reserves and switches the server. A
separate `acquire` followed by `switch` would leave a race between the calls.
If switching fails, the result reports both the failed runtime transition and
whether the lease remains held so recovery is unambiguous.

Reservation guarantees apply only to Worktree Switcher operations. They cannot
prevent a human from killing a process or changing files outside the tool, so
status reconciliation must continue to report external changes.

## MCP shape

MCP is an adapter over the same application services used by UI and CLI. It
does not receive direct filesystem, Git, process, or persistence access.

The primary local transport is MCP Streamable HTTP on a dedicated loopback-only
listener:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:47832/mcp
```

It runs inside the existing controller, so connecting an agent does not create
another persistent Node.js process. The MCP SDK is loaded lazily on first use.
The endpoint requires a persistent bearer token stored in an owner-only file;
`worktree-switcher config mcp` prints the client configuration on explicit
request. A future stdio command may act as a compatibility proxy for clients
without Streamable HTTP support.

Read-only MCP resources:

```text
worktree-switcher://projects
worktree-switcher://capacity
worktree-switcher://projects/{projectId}/status
worktree-switcher://projects/{projectId}/worktrees
```

Initial MCP tools:

```text
list_projects
get_server_capacity
get_project_status
get_project_storage
list_worktrees
list_environment_profiles
save_environment_profile
select_environment_profile
delete_environment_profile
claim_project
renew_project_claim
release_project_claim
```

Environment-profile tools apply to every managed runtime, including Django.
They expose named literal values but never inherited host values or a hidden
lease token. Profile mutations remain audited, reject controller-owned `PORT`
and `NODE_ENV`, and require the managed server to be stopped; the browser may
instead request an explicit stop-and-restart transaction.

`claim_project` accepts a project, discovered worktree path, reason,
requested TTL, and idempotency key. It atomically acquires an agent lease and,
when needed, switches the server. Its result contains an explicit lease handle
but never exposes the raw lease token. The MCP session retains that secret and
uses it for explicit and automatic renewals and release operations.

If controller-wide server capacity is exhausted, a new claim remains held but
reports the startup error explicitly. Agents can call `get_server_capacity`
before claiming to read the configured limit, current usage, available slots,
and projects holding them.

`list_projects` and `get_project_status` also return the read-only resource
snapshot for each managed server: aggregate current and peak RSS, CPU,
process count, sample time, bounded RAM history, and availability state. MCP
reads the same in-memory snapshot as the dashboard and never starts its own
sampler.

`get_project_storage` returns the latest persisted disk breakdown and bounded
history for each discovered worktree. It does not start a filesystem scan;
missing or stale measurements are scheduled by the dashboard or refreshed by
an explicit authenticated browser action.

Listing and status remain available without acquiring a lease. Mutations that
would violate an existing reservation return a typed conflict. Arbitrary shell
commands, arbitrary paths, force release, and indefinite agent locks are never
exposed as MCP tools.

## Security and audit

- The MCP endpoint binds only to `127.0.0.1`, validates `Origin`, and requires a
  bearer token read from a protected local file rather than command-line args.
- Every mutation records actor, MCP client identity, project, worktree, reason,
  timestamp, outcome, and lease ID without recording the raw token.
- SQLite persists reservations and append-only audit events; the controller is
  the only database owner and all adapters use the same transactional service.
- Tool inputs use strict schemas and project/worktree identifiers are resolved
  against controller-owned discovery results.
- UI and CLI clearly show owner, reason, age, expiry, and whether the process
  still matches the reserved worktree.
- Remote and multi-user MCP access remains a separate security design.

## Deferred MCP work

- Optional stdio compatibility proxy.
- Client-specific configuration helpers beyond the generic JSON output.
- Remote authorization and user accounts.
