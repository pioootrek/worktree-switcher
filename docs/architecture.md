# Architecture decisions

## Runtime shape

Worktree Switcher ships as one long-lived Node.js process. Next.js is a build
tool for the App Router UI, configured with `output: "export"`; its generated
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are package assets served by the controller. There is
no `next start` process and no server rendering at runtime.

The process contains four replaceable layers:

1. A thin HTTP layer serving static assets, JSON endpoints, and an SSE event
   stream on the configured local interface.
2. Application services coordinating projects, switching, readiness, and
   configuration.
3. Domain interfaces for persistence, Git inspection, process execution,
   clocks, and event publication.
4. Local adapters backed by SQLite, the Git CLI, Node child processes, and the
   filesystem.

The layers are module boundaries inside one process, not separate services.
This keeps idle memory and startup overhead low while preserving extraction
points if a future multi-user edition needs a remote control plane.

## GUI foundation

The statically exported Next.js dashboard uses shadcn/ui with the `new-york`
style and Radix base. Components are copied into `src/components/ui` and owned
by this repository; application-specific composition remains outside that
directory. Tailwind CSS and CSS variables provide the design tokens.

The UI is dark-first with a system/light option. Geist Sans is used for
interface text and Geist Mono for branches, commits, paths, ports, commands,
timestamps, and lease identifiers. Foundational surfaces use semantic tokens
such as `background`, `card`, `foreground`, `muted`, `border`, and `ring`
instead of ad-hoc palette values.

Initial primitives are installed only when their owning flow is implemented:

- `Button`, `Card`, `Badge`, and `Table` for project/runtime overview;
- `Tabs`, `Select`, `Tooltip`, and `ScrollArea` for worktree selection and logs;
- `Dialog` for editing and `AlertDialog` for stop, force-release, and other
  destructive confirmations;
- `Skeleton`, `Alert`, and empty states for loading, failures, and no-project
  onboarding;
- `Sheet` for responsive project navigation.

Runtime and reservation status never relies on color alone. Each state has a
label, icon, and accessible description. Keyboard navigation, visible focus,
reduced motion, and screen-reader announcements for process transitions are
part of acceptance criteria.

The shadcn CLI is initialized non-interactively with defaults and an explicit
Radix base. Components are added selectively, reviewed as application source,
and never bulk-installed with `--all`.

## Process ownership and shutdown

The controller records identity only for process trees it starts. On normal
exit, `SIGINT`, or `SIGTERM`, it stops those trees gracefully, waits for the
configured shutdown timeout, and then escalates only against the same verified
owned tree. A PID loaded after restart is never trusted without identity
reconciliation.

An occupied project port owned by an unknown process is a conflict, not
permission to terminate it. The dashboard reports the port and diagnostic
information, while recovery stays an explicit user action outside the tool.

Dirty worktrees are valid development targets. The dashboard displays a
persistent warning and the dirty-state timestamp but does not block start,
restart, switch, or reservation.

`autoStart` defaults to false. Project registration is explicit, dependency
installation is never automatic, and stopping a server does not release its
reservation.

## Resource policy

Managed development applications have priority over Worktree Switcher. The
controller must be event-driven and have bounded memory use:

- no recursive filesystem watcher over managed repositories;
- no continuous Git polling while the dashboard is closed;
- lazy dirty-state calculation with debounced refresh;
- bounded per-project and global log buffers;
- one controller process and no resident Next.js runtime;
- release benchmarks report idle RSS, idle CPU, startup time, and growth while
  managing several fixture projects.

Initial acceptance targets are at most 50 MiB idle RSS and negligible idle CPU
on the supported Linux reference environment. These are budgets to verify, not
assumptions about Node.js behavior.

## Persistence

Application code depends on a transactional `StateStore` rather than SQL APIs.
The unit of work groups project configuration, reservations, and audit events
so one use case can commit them atomically:

```ts
interface StateStore {
  transaction<T>(work: (tx: StateTransaction) => T): T
}

interface StateTransaction {
  projects: ProjectStore
  reservations: ReservationStore
  audit: AuditStore
}
```

The MVP uses `better-sqlite3`: it is stable, provides prebuilt binaries for
major supported platforms, and avoids depending on the current release-candidate
status of Node's built-in `node:sqlite` module. The driver remains private to
the adapter so it can be replaced without changing application services.

On Linux the database lives at
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/worktree-switcher/state.sqlite3`, falling back to
`~/.local/share/worktree-switcher/state.sqlite3`. Logs live below
`$XDG_STATE_HOME/worktree-switcher/`, falling back to
`~/.local/state/worktree-switcher/`. The same environment variables and
fallback directories are used on the supported macOS build.

The controller opens one database connection, enables foreign keys and WAL,
uses prepared statements, and runs numbered migrations before accepting
requests. A state-directory lock prevents two controller instances with the
same runtime configuration from owning the process set. Stored PIDs are hints
only; restart reconciliation verifies process identity before acting on them.

Reservation acquisition uses a short `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction: expire old
leases, check the active reservation, insert the new reservation, and append
the audit event before commit. A partial unique index enforces at most one
unreleased reservation per project. Raw lease tokens are never stored.

The initial schema contains `schema_migrations`, `settings`, `projects`,
`reservations`, and append-only `audit_events`. Logs and Git-derived worktree
metadata are not stored as relational history in the MVP. Database backup uses
the SQLite backup API rather than copying live database/WAL files.

Accounts would also require authentication, authorization, ownership,
and audit semantics; SQLite alone does not make the application multi-user.

## Project configuration model

The following is the application/API representation, not a JSON file persisted
on disk:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "server": {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "port": 3410,
    "openBrowser": true
  },
  "projects": [
    {
      "id": "frontend",
      "name": "Web App",
      "repositoryPath": "/projects/web-app",
      "port": 3000,
      "command": {
        "executable": "pnpm",
        "args": ["dev", "--", "--port", "{port}"]
      },
      "environment": {
        "NODE_ENV": "development"
      },
      "healthcheck": {
        "path": "/",
        "timeoutMs": 30000
      },
      "autoStart": false
    }
  ]
}
```

Unknown database schema versions fail with an actionable error. Project IDs are
stable, URL-safe keys. Ports must be unique among simultaneously running projects.
Repository paths are canonicalized during registration. The browser sends a
discovered worktree identifier, not a command or arbitrary filesystem path.

Environment values are explicit overrides merged onto a deliberately filtered
controller environment. Secrets should remain in the managed project's normal
environment mechanism and must not be copied into the database by default.

Each project stores a validated launch preset. Existing records migrate to the
Node.js preset. New registrations may select automatic detection, Node.js, or
Django; automatic detection is resolved to a concrete preset before storage.
The concrete executable and arguments are resolved against the selected
worktree before every start. Django therefore uses a worktree-local `.venv` or
`venv` when present and otherwise invokes `python3`, always through `shell:false`.

## CLI and package

The public npm package is `worktree-switcher` with one `bin` entry of the same
name. The package has not been published yet. The built executable currently
supports:

```text
worktree-switcher [start] [--no-open]
worktree-switcher config path
worktree-switcher config mcp
worktree-switcher service install [--refresh]
worktree-switcher service status|start|stop|restart|open|url|uninstall
```

Project registration still belongs to the dashboard. Project removal, CLI
project management, and `doctor` are backlog items, not part of the current
interface.

Until the package is published, source-checkout commands use the built entry
point:

```bash
node dist/cli/index.js start
node dist/cli/index.js service install
```

Foreground mode is the evaluation and diagnostic path. The recommended daily
setup is an explicit user-service installation. Linux uses
`~/.config/systemd/user/worktree-switcher.service`; macOS uses
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.worktree-switcher.controller.plist`.

The generated definition contains absolute executable, dashboard, data, and
state paths. Its environment has `NODE_ENV=production` and a controlled `PATH`
that includes the Node.js executable directory and standard system binary
directories. The service starts with the user's platform session. Both
platform definitions throttle failure retries to five seconds; systemd also
caps the restart burst.

The service never stores pairing URLs or bearer tokens in its definition or
manager logs. Once listeners are ready, the controller writes the current
browser URL to an owner-only state file. `service open` reads it without
printing it; `service url` prints it only after an explicit request.

`service status` combines manager state with the runtime access record and a
single `ps` sample. It reports PID, uptime, version, endpoints, restart and exit
data when the platform provides them, controller RSS, controller CPU, and log
locations. Full process-tree resource monitoring for managed servers remains a
separate feature.

The controller acquires an atomic state-directory lock before opening SQLite,
binding listeners, or creating a process manager. A live lock rejects a second
foreground or service instance that uses the same state directory. A stale
lock is replaced only after its PID no longer exists.

On normal `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, the controller closes listeners and gracefully
stops every process tree it owns. systemd's `KillMode=control-group` and the
LaunchAgent process-group policy cover unexpected controller failure. Unknown
processes that happen to occupy configured project ports remain untouched.

Upgrade refresh is explicit:

```bash
worktree-switcher service install --refresh
```

Without `--refresh`, installation refuses to replace a definition that points
at different paths or settings. Uninstall removes only the user-service
artifact and preserves the database, tokens, configuration, and logs.
