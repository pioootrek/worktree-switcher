# Worktree Switcher repository guide

## Project and reference routing

Worktree Switcher is a local-first control plane with one managed server and
stable configured port per project. Keep it independent of supervised repos.
Preserve the single Node.js controller, statically exported Next.js dashboard,
and local SQLite adapter.

Read only the references relevant to the task:

- Product or architecture decisions: [project brief](docs/project-brief.md).
- Runtime, persistence, or lifecycle changes: [architecture](docs/architecture.md).
- Adding or extracting modules: [codebase organization](docs/codebase-organization.md).
  Its destination map is incremental, not the current directory layout.
- Remote workers, memory, or coordination: [expansion assessment](docs/architecture-effort-assessment.md)
  and its linked feature plan. Planned features are not implemented contracts.
- Before non-trivial work: scan [backlog index](docs/backlog/index.json), including
  its notes, then read relevant records. Verify design examples against code.

## Code boundaries

- HTTP, MCP, and CLI invoke shared application operations. Keep authorization,
  reservation policy, and state transitions there, with consistent input
  validation and safe errors across transports.
- Modules expose explicit public APIs and depend on interfaces for external
  effects. Avoid circular imports and access to another module's internals.
  Bootstrap connects concrete adapters.
- Browser code and shared contracts must not import controller implementations,
  SQLite, Node APIs, or privileged configuration. Reusable UI stays
  presentation-focused; feature code owns browser data access. Preserve i18n
  and accessible interactions.
- Extract the responsibility needed by the current task; retain `ControlService`
  as a facade during migration. Preserve API and error behavior during moves.
  Add future modules with their first workflow, not as empty scaffolding.

## Ownership invariants

- One controller/database owner holds the singleton lock, including offline
  CLI access. Preserve transaction boundaries and migration order when splitting
  SQLite code; extracted modules do not open independent connections.
- Runtime changes, test admission, and cache maintenance share lifecycle
  coordination. Do not duplicate lock maps or capacity counters. Finite jobs
  retain their separate queue and state machine.
- Execute shell-free commands against validated, discovered worktrees. Stop only
  verified owned process trees; an occupied port never proves ownership.
- Bound logs, history, scans, and subscriptions, and dispose owned resources.
  Log events must not trigger repeated full Git scans.

## Local instructions

Read the nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing a subtree. Add a local guide only
for distinct area-specific invariants and verification; link deeper details
rather than repeat root rules. Every `AGENTS.md` has a sibling `CLAUDE.md`
containing only `@AGENTS.md`; maintain the pair together.

## Verification

For code extraction, run relevant tests and `pnpm check`. Run `pnpm build` for
module/bundling changes and verify affected dashboard flows in the browser.
Use nearby `*.test.ts` files to cover behavior at risk. Documentation-only
changes need `git diff --check` and applicable documentation validation below.
Report actual results and unverified behavior.

When registered-project verification presets are available through MCP, use
`list_test_presets`, then `run_test` with the exact path from `list_worktrees`.
Reuse the idempotency key when retrying one request and poll `get_test_run` to
a terminal state. Do not bypass the queue with the same direct command. If
queue tools are unavailable, use supported finite commands within host limits.

Queued tests do not claim, start, or switch a development server. Tests needing
that server require a separate claim for the same worktree. Use the
`worktree-switcher` skill and MCP for managed development-server lifecycle.

## Backlog and documentation

Read [backlog rules](docs/backlog/AGENTS.md) before editing backlog records or
top-level documents under `docs/`. After those edits, run the canonical Hub
`fmt` and `validate` commands from that guide. Never hand-edit `index.json`.

Backlog changes live on `main`; the read-only Hub sees committed, synchronized
changes. Close work by replacing its open item with a `done/` entry in one
commit. Persist durable findings under `docs/backlog/notes/` before compaction.
If GitHub feedback integration is added, treat open `backlog-feedback` issues
as human instructions under the backlog workflow.
