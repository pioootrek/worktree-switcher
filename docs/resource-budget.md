# Controller resource budget

Measure the controller's overhead above a bare Node HTTP process on the same
host and Node version. The historical absolute 50 MiB RSS target was below the
observed runtime floor and is no longer an acceptance criterion. Managed
applications retain resource priority.

## Acceptance criteria

The canonical benchmark requires all three independent runs to satisfy:

| Metric | Budget |
| --- | --- |
| Median controller RSS minus baseline, with 0 or 3 stopped projects | at most 32 MiB |
| Median controller RSS minus baseline, with 3 running projects | at most 96 MiB |
| Post-cycle median RSS minus pre-cycle median RSS, with the same three servers running | at most 32 MiB |
| Controller CPU with 0 or 3 stopped projects | at most 0.5% of one logical CPU |
| Controller CPU while monitoring 3 running projects | at most 5% of one logical CPU |
| Retained runtime logs / resource-history points per project | at most 400 lines / 60 points |

The numbers are implemented in `scripts/resource-metrics.mjs`. CPU is accumulated
user plus system process time divided by elapsed monotonic time, not a share of
all host CPUs. RSS includes the Node runtime, native SQLite allocations and
resident mapped pages; it is not V8 heap usage or an exact allocation counter.
The baseline difference estimates incremental resident cost. It does not
attribute every page to application code.

Use the median to reduce sensitivity to individual samples; retain peak RSS
and every raw sample for diagnosis. Peaks cover the idle observation windows,
not the unobserved instant of a log burst. A passing median does not prove that memory
can never grow over a longer session. This bounded workload supplements the
implementation's fixed log/history limits and regression tests. The retained-log
check covers runtime tails. Batching disk writes reduces allocation overhead
but does not impose a pending-byte limit or backpressure on continuous output
that exceeds disk throughput; this finite workload does not certify that case.

## Reproduce the benchmark

On Linux with `/proc` available, Node and Git installed:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm check
pnpm build
pnpm bench:resources --report /tmp/switcher-resources.json
```

The command verifies the build fingerprint before starting. The JSON report
records the Git revision, source fingerprint, bundle and benchmark script
hashes, Node/kernel/CPU details, sampling parameters, load averages, raw samples,
individual budget checks and cleanup result. A failed measurement or cleanup
returns non-zero. Missing samples never become a passing zero.

Each of three runs creates fresh temporary state and performs these phases in
order. Every phase settles for 15 seconds and then samples once per second for
30 seconds. There is an initial sample plus 30 intervals. Settling covers three
five-second resource-sampler periods, and observation covers six more.

1. Bare Node HTTP server, then stop it.
2. Built foreground controller with no registered projects.
3. The same controller with three registered, stopped projects.
4. Three running fixture servers, before the repeated workload.
5. The same three running slots after 30 sequential worktree switches, each
   followed by 2,000 log lines of 129 bytes. Total workload is 60,000 lines.

Each fixture is a dependency-free Node server in a real Git repository with two
worktrees. The controller uses its real SQLite database, launch adapter, HTTP
operations, log writer and resource sampler. HTTP and MCP listeners are enabled;
there are no connected browser/SSE or MCP clients during measurement. This is
an idle-controller gate, not evidence about open dashboards or agent load.

The baseline and controller use the same test-only Node preload
`scripts/resource-probe.mjs`. One IPC request per sample reads
`process.memoryUsage.rss()` and `process.cpuUsage()` inside the measured process.
Its overhead is present in both runs. The driver, browser and managed server
memory/CPU are excluded from controller measurements. No forced GC is requested. Linux monitoring uses at most eight concurrent
workers per scan, each reusing an 8 KiB buffer for process stat/status records.
Records of exactly 8 KiB are accepted after an EOF probe using the same buffer.
An oversized record rejects the sample after all worker descriptors close, so
monitoring reports unavailable instead of publishing an incomplete group total.
The disk log writer batches queued lines into writes of up to 64 KiB (except
an individually larger line), preserving line boundaries at rotation and
flushing accepted output on close. This avoids per-line promise chains.

Run builds, browser suites and this benchmark sequentially. Schedule sampling
away from other heavy host work and retain the load metadata. Investigate a
failure on a busy host and record any rerun; do not silently select the best
run. These are release checks rather than a noisy mandatory per-PR RSS gate.
`pnpm check` runs deterministic tests of the metric calculation.

## Check that the gate detects a regression

```sh
pnpm bench:resources --runs 1 --negative-control --report /tmp/switcher-resources-negative.json
```

This uses the same controller and workload. Immediately before the final phase,
the test-only preload retains and touches an extra 128 MiB buffer in the
controller process. The command must return non-zero, the report must name a
failed memory check, and cleanup must still be graceful. This is a bounded
runtime fault injection into the release bundle, not an intentionally shipped
production defect. It tests sensitivity to retained memory; it does not by
itself establish sensitivity to every CPU or Git-polling regression.

Shorter `--runs`, `--warmup`, `--seconds` and `--cycles` values are useful for
checking the driver. Such reports have `canonical: false` and cannot certify
release acceptance. Increasing the observation duration is appropriate when
investigating gradual growth; record the changed parameters.

## Isolation and interpretation

The benchmark owns only its freshly spawned processes and temporary directories.
It records observed descendant identities with Linux process start ticks and
checks they have exited after controller shutdown. Emergency termination fails
the run. It never treats an occupied port or a recycled PID as ownership.
It does not install, restart or reconfigure a user service, change host resource
guards, or use a registered project's development port.

Record fresh release evidence under `docs/backlog/notes/`. Historical RSS values
remain dated observations, not current promises. Broader multi-project
acceptance still needs its browser and owner-workflow evidence.

Measured evidence for the implementation incorporating PR #20 is recorded in
[the 2026-09-09 acceptance report](backlog/notes/NOTE-20260909-controller-resource-budget/findings.md),
including raw samples, failed candidates, margin and the negative control.
